## Before We Start the Tutorial

Welcome to the iNano Tutorial. The following pages will take you on a brief self-guided tour of the structure visualization and integrative analysis abilities in Virtual Reality of the iNano. We will show a model with all if options in iNano during this tutorial. It will give you a deep understanding of iNano.

The tutorial is divided into two sections:

- [Introduction](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html#setup-for-the-tutorial) will give you **a starting point** to follow the tutorial.
- [Overview](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html#overview) will teach you the fundamentals of iNano: functions and features.
- [VR Mode](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html#adding-time-travel) will teach you use iNano in Virtual Reality.
- [Desktop Mode](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html#completing-the-game) will teach you use iNano on the desktop.
- [Sharing URL]() will teach you use iNano with a sharing URL which can be embeded into your own webpage with only a single line HTML code.

You don’t have to complete all of the sections at once to get the value out of this tutorial. Try to get as far as you can — even if it’s one or two sections.

It’s fine to copy and paste code as you’re following along the tutorial, but we recommend to try it by hand with VR devices. This will help you develop a muscle memory and a stronger understanding.

## Introduction

iNano, a for molecular structure visualization and integrative analysis. iNano connects to multi-source translational and drug data from the cloud in a fully immersive VR environment. The immersive experience of iNano improves the visualization, calculation, and editing of complex structures. iNano is web-based  system and connects to disease-related and drug databases, and thus can serve as an integrative platform to aid in structure-based translational researches and drug design. iNano is freely available at <https://inano.zhanglab.net>.

- iNano enables users to explore macromolecular structures in virtual reality from a web browser.
- iNano provides a cloud-based platform to access multiple resources for integrated structural studies.

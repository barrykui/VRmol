## Before We Start the Tutorial

We will show a model with all if options in iNano during this tutorial. The techniques you’ll learn in the tutorial are fundamental to visualizing molecular in virtual reality, and mastering it will give you a deep understanding of iNano.

The tutorial is divided into two sections:

- [Introduction](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html#setup-for-the-tutorial) will give you **a starting point** to follow the tutorial.
- [Overview](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html#overview) will teach you the fundamentals of iNano: functions and features.
- [VR Mode](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html#adding-time-travel) will teach use iNano in VR.
- [Desktop Mode](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html#completing-the-game) will teach you use iNano on the desktop.
- 

You don’t have to complete all of the sections at once to get the value out of this tutorial. Try to get as far as you can — even if it’s one or two sections.

It’s fine to copy and paste code as you’re following along the tutorial, but we recommend to type it by hand. This will help you develop a muscle memory and a stronger understanding.

## Introduction

- iNano enables users to explore macromolecular structures in virtual reality from a web browser.
- iNano provides a cloud-based platform to access multiple resources for integrated structural studies.
